# TankDevCourseFiles-4.23
Second part of Gamedev.tv's course on Udemy to learn Unreal Engine
Toy project to go in depth about Unreal Engine's uses.

This project is the second part of an Udemy course by Gamedev.Tv (https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/)

The goal of this is to have a first look at Unreal's different aspects to create a very basic "game".

## Getting Started

Project made on Unreal 4.22 then ported to 4.23, you can download Unreal on https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/,
Or you can build it from the sources by following this guide https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github.

Once unreal is installed, you can add this project to your projects list and then launch it.

## Playing the game

### Commands

You can interact in this game by using:
 * W => Forward.
 * Q => Left.

## What I learned.
The fundamentals of unreal :<br/>

* How to use the Landscape creator.
* How to apply texture.
* How to use sockets on meshes.
* How to apply and modify the hitbox of a mesh.
* Using UCLASS, UPROPERTY, UFUNCTION meta.
* Basic use of the navmesh.
* How to create a UI.
* Change Scenes.
* Modify FX and how they work.
* Refactor code.
* Red Green Blue developement methods.
* Creating BPs:
  * Choose the class inheritance.
  * Using multiple meshes for the same BP.
  * Link meshes to sockets.
  * Use the Input Setup and Construction Script.
  * Add FXs.
* Navigate through UE issues report (https://issues.unrealengine.com/).
* Better myself at searching how to fix/get around a bug or glitch(ex: Hot reload resetting meshes in BPs).

## TODO

* Finish this course.
* Fix UE's Landscape "jumpy" glitch (A fix to seems to be exporting the landscape to a 3DRender software and export it back
to Unreal).
* Complete "What I learned section with what I will learn in the next videos.
